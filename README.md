Restaurant Management Software



The domain that we are going to model is running a restaurant (chain). We are going to focus on
the management of the business such as staffing, suppliers, and financial information.
We are focusing on the management of the restaurant, including staffing (chefs, servers,
bussers) and the information associated (salary, responsibilities, personal information,
schedules), inventory (quantity of food, when to order, what to order), and finances (revenues,
costs).

The target audience for the application will be the owner, aiming to centralize and facilitate
restaurant management. The owner will be able to access information about the financial state
of the restaurant, be able to pay their employees and suppliers, view what menu items are most
popular, and to track inventory to see what to order.
